# pydo - Plan Your Daily Output

A simple, local-first todo list manager for your terminal.

## Panic! You Didn't Organize
Do you find to-do lists useful for tracking your daily development (and other) tasks?
Are you also a terminal rat who hates switching to the browser to click (!?) on a checkbox in some web based tool?

Say no more -- `pydo` is here to help!

`pydo` helps you manage tasks directly from the command line. It supports a global todo list for general tasks and project-specific lists that you can manage from within your project directories.

Project still in early development. Once core features are finished, I will create an installation guide so you can play around with it to.

Until then, check out [CLI Command Design](https://github.com/aleksavidovic/pydo-cli/blob/main/CLI_COMMAND_DESIGN.md) document to get the general idea of the project.
